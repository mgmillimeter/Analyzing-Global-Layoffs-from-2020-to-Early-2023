## I. Project Background
This project examines layoffs across the globe from 2020 to 2023, providing insights into economic trends, industry impacts, and corporate strategies. By analyzing data on layoffs by year, industry, company, country, and company funding stage, we aim to understand the dynamics of workforce reduction in various contexts. This study identifies patterns, highlights sectors most affected, and offers insights for businesses, policymakers, and job seekers.

Key areas of focus include:
- **_Layoffs by Year_**: Understanding annual trends in workforce reduction.
- **_Industry Impact_**: Identifying which industries have seen the most layoffs.
- **_Company Analysis_**: Mapping layoffs to specific companies to see corporate responses to economic changes.
- **_Geographic Distribution_**: Analyzing how layoffs vary by country, reflecting economic health and policy impact.
- **_Funding Stage Impact_**: Evaluating how a company's maturity affects its layoff decisions.

## II. Data Structure Overview

The layoffs dataset as seen below consists of 1 table: Layoffs_Dataset with a total row count of 1,343 records.
